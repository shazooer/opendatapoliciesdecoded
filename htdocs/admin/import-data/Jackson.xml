"Sensitive information" means any data which, if published on the Open Data Portal, could raise privacy, confidentiality or security concerns or have the potential to jeopardize public health, safety or welfare to an extent that is greater than the potential public benefit of publishing that data.</p> <p>g.

Oversee the creation of a comprehensive inventory of datasets held by each City department which is published to the Open Data Portal and regularly updated;</p> <p>3.	Develop and implement a process for determining the relative level of risk and public benefit associated with potentially sensitive, non-protected information so as to make a determination about whether and how to publish it;</p> <p>4.

Establish processes for publishing datasets to the Open Data Portal, including processes for ensuring that datasets are reviewed for use-appropriate formats, quality, timeliness, and exclusion of protected and sensitive information;</p> <p>6.

The report shall include an assessment of progress towards achievement of the goals of the City's open data program, a list of datasets currently available on the Open Data Portal, and a description and publication timeline for datasets envisioned to be published on the portal in the following year. Following this initial report, the Governance Committee shall submit an updated report yearly.</p> <p>b)	During the review and reporting period, the Governance Committee should also make suggestions for improving the City's open data management processes in order to ensure that the City continues to move towards the achievement of the policy's goals.</p> <p>_________________________</p> <p>Tony T.
