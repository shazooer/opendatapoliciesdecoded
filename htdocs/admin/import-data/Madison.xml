Such public data sets shall be accessible to external search capabilities.</p> <p>(g) Prioritizing Availability of Data Sets.

Agencies shall also consider the following factors in prioritizing access to data sets:</p> <p>1. Whether the data set can be utilized to increase agency accountability and/or responsiveness;</p> <p>2. Whether use of the data set could improve public knowledge of the agency, its missions, operations and resources;</p> <p>3. Whether it furthers the agencies missions;</p> <p>4. Whether the data set creates or has the capacity to create economic opportunities;</p> <p>5. Whether the data set responds to any need or demand identified by public consultation, and;</p> <p>6. The accuracy and completeness of the data set, i.e., preliminary, inaccurate or misleading data sets should not be published in order to avoid misleading or confusing the public. Such a determination regarding publication does not foreclose a requesters access to such data sets under either the Wisconsin Public Records Laws (Wis. Stats. §§ 19.31-19.47) or the Madison Public Records ordinance (Sec. 3.70, MGO).</p> <p></p> <p>(h) Public Feedback. The Department shall investigate the feasibility of establishing an on-line forum or other mechanism to solicit feedback from the public.</p> <p>(i) Preservation of Bandwidth. The Department may take reasonable measures to maintain bandwidth availability of the city’s website.</p> <p>(j) Cost Benefit Determination. Each agency, in consultation with the Department, shall determine whether the costs of converting any publicly available data set to a searchable and publishable digital format outweigh any potential public benefit derived from such publication. If an agency determines that such costs outweigh the benefits of publication, then such data sets shall be maintained in their original format subject to inspection as provided by the Wisconsin Public Records Laws (Wis. Stats. §§ 19.31-19.47) and the Madison Public Records ordinance (Sec. 3.70, MGO).</p> <p>(k) No Release of Data Sets That Would Endanger Safety. In accordance with Wis. Stat. § 19.35(1)(am)2.a., Secs. 3.70(1) & (6)(c), MGO, the City shall not make available under this ordinance, any data or data set the release of which would endanger an individual’s life or safety.</p> <p>(4) Open Data Legal Policy.</p> <p>a. The Department shall conspicuously publish the following Open Data Legal Policy on the city’s website:</p> <p>Public data sets made available on the web portal are provided for informational purposes. The City does not warranty the completeness, accuracy, content or fitness for any particular purpose or use of any public data set made available on the web portal, nor are any such warranties to be implied or inferred with respect to the public data sets furnished therein.</p> <p>The City is not liable for any deficiencies in the completeness, accuracy, content or fitness for any particular purpose or use of any public data set, or application utilizing such data set, provided by any third party.</p> <p>Discontinuance of Data: The City reserves the right to discontinue availability of content on this website at any time and for any reason. The City reserves the right to claim or seek to protect any patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights in any of the information, images, software, or processes displayed or used at this website. If the City claims or seeks to protect any intellectual property rights in any of the information, images, software, or processes displayed or used at this website, then this website will so indicate on the webpage on or from which such information, images, software, or processes are accessed. These Terms of Use do not grant anyone any title or right to any patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights that the City may have in any of the information, images, software, or processes displayed or used at this website.</p> <p>Nothing in the City’s Open Data ordinance or policies shall be construed to create a private right of action to enforce any of their provisions and therefore, any failure to comply with these provisions shall not result in liability to an agency.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>
