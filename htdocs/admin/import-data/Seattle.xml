This Open Data Policy defines the principles governing City of Seattle Open Data and describes the expectations for department participation and governance of the Seattle Open Data Program. Definitions City of Seattle Data All data created, collected and/or maintained by the City of Seattle or by contractors or agencies on the City’s behalf.

Open Data Program Program dedicated to making City of Seattle data available to the public and engaging civic technologists, the research community, and other partners to make use of Open Data in support of the Program’s goals. Open Data Playbook Guide defining strategies City departments and offices can implement to making their data open, encourage public use consistent with the City’s privacy and security policies, and realize benefits for their departments. Open Data Portal Data.seattle.gov, the City’s catalog and primary repository for Open Data, created and maintained by the City for the express purpose of ensuring permanent, lasting open access to public information and Open Data Policy V1.0 February 1, 2016 2 enabling the development of innovative solutions that exemplify the goals of the Open Data Program.

Policy The City of Seattle strives to make the data it generates and collects openly available to the public for the purposes of increasing the quality of life for our residents; increasing transparency, accountability and comparability; promoting economic development and research; and improving internal performance management. Open Data Program Goals The Open Data Program exists explicitly to: A. Improve public understanding of City operations and other information concerning their communities. B. Generate economic opportunity for individuals and companies that benefit from the knowledge created by Open Data. C. Empower City employees to be more effective, better coordinated internally, and identify opportunities to better serve the public. D. Encourage the development of innovative technology solutions that improve quality of life. Section 1: Open by Preference A. The City of Seattle and parties acting on its behalf shall proactively make City data holdings available and shall make the information available through the City’s Open Data Open Data Policy V1.0 February 1, 2016 3 Portal, subject to the limitations outlined in this policy and the operating procedures of the Open Data Program. B. When planning for new systems or data collection projects, or modifying existing systems or processes, City departments and offices shall consider which datasets and associated metadata should be published as Open Data. C. Whenever technically possible, Open Data shall be published in machine-readable format. D. Datasets on the Open Data Portal shall be made available without registration requirement, license requirement or restrictions on their use provided that the department may require a third party providing to the public any public data set, or application utilizing such data set, to explicitly identify the source and version of the public data set, and a description of any modifications made to such public data set. E. While a preference is towards making all data public, some data elements if released, especially in bulk, could cause privacy harms, put critical infrastructure at risk, or put public safety personnel and initiatives at risk. City departments and offices should use tools provided by the Open Data Program to assess risk as part of determining datasets to be released. F. The requirements set forth in the policy shall be integrated into the Municipal Information Technology Investment Evaluation (MITIE) process, questionnaire and checklists to help facilitate consistent identification and publishing of datasets as the City plans for the implementation of new technologies and systems. G. Should the Open Data Program discover that data is being used in ways that violate privacy, puts the public at risk, or contravene the Program’s goals, the City of Seattle and parties acting on its behalf have the right and responsibility to take any action necessary to mitigate these risks. Section 2: Accountability City department and office directors shall: A. Direct department Data Owners to make the department’s data holdings and accompanying metadata available to the public on the City’s Open Data Portal, subject to the limitations outlined in this policy and the operating procedures of the Open Data Program.

Department data catalogs shall be combined into a master City of Seattle data catalog which shall be made publicly viewable. D. Make data and accompanying metadata open in machine-readable form. The metadata scheme shall allow data publishers to classify selected contextual fields or elements within their dataset as well as adhere to common Meta attributes identified platform-wide, thus empowering data consumers to build automated discovery mechanisms at a granular level.

Using a common metadata taxonomy will allow the Open Data Program to increase discoverability and facilitate successful use of the data. E.
