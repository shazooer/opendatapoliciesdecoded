<p>ORDINANCE NUMBER 1370</p> <p>Final Publication Number 3376.</p> <p>First Publication in the Chronicle on August 13, 20145</p> <p>City of Cambridge</p> <p>In the Year Two Thousand and Fifteen</p> <p>AN ORDINANCE</p> <p>In amendment to the Ordinance entitled “Municipal Code of the City of Cambridge”</p> <p>Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Cambridge that the Municipal Ordinances of the City of Cambridge be amended:</p> <p>Chapter 2.126 – Open Data Ordinance</p> <p>2.126.010 – Title and Purpose</p> <p>A. This Chapter shall be known as the “Open Data Ordinance.” The purpose of this ordinance is to ensure that, in an increasingly technological age, the City of Cambridge (the “City”) is committed to providing the public with a high level of transparency, engagement and collaboration in City government.</p> <p>B. The City shall make reasonable efforts to make the Open Data available, on a schedule determined by the City Manager.</p> <p>C. The City anticipates that making government data open in easy to find and usable formats will create effective and meaningful opportunities for the City and members of the public to work collaboratively to generate new ideas to solve complex challenges. An open data initiative will allow a more diverse body of expertise to develop new analyses, insights and findings that will allow the City to provide more efficient and effective government services.</p> <p>D. This initiative must be balanced with the City’s obligation to protect private and confidential information and to ensure public safety and security, and the need to conduct City operations in an efficient and effective manner.</p> <p></p> <p>2.126.020 – Definitions</p> <p>As used in this Chapter:</p> <p>A. “API” shall mean an application programming interface that specifies how software components should interact with each other.</p> <p>B. “Data” or “Data Sets” shall mean a collection of final versions of relevant statistical, factual, geographical, or other information:</p> <p>1. collected in an alphanumeric form reflected in a list, table, graph, chart, or similar form that can be digitally transmitted or processed;</p> <p>2. regularly created or maintained by or on behalf of and owned by the City that records a measurement, transaction, or determination related to the business of the City;</p> <p>3. includes metadata, if available, consistent with core metadata standards at a level of granularity recommended by the Open Data Review Board (defined below) and a description of the methods used in creating the Data or Data Set, including a comprehensive list of sources;</p> <p>4. maintained in a manner that is Machine Readable.</p> <p>Data or Data Sets shall not include Protected Data (defined below) or information provided to the City by other governmental entities. Nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to prohibit the City from voluntarily disclosing information not otherwise defined in this section as “Data” or “Data Sets,” including, when appropriate, narrative in machine readable text, as long it is not Protected Data.</p> <p>C. “ITD” means the City’s Information Technology Department.</p> <p>D. “Machine Readable” means in a format that is reasonably structured to allow automated processing.</p> <p>E. “Massachusetts Public Records Law” shall mean M.G.L. c. 4, § 7(26), M.G.L. c. 66, § 10, and 950 CMR 32.</p> <p>F. “Protected Data” means any Data or Data Set:</p> <p>1. that is exempt from disclosure pursuant to Massachusetts Laws, including but not limited to the Massachusetts Public Records Law; or</p> <p>2. that contains a significant amount of Data and where the disclosure of such Data would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the City; or</p> <p>3. that reflects the internal deliberative or administrative process(es) of the City, including, but not limited to, Data and Data Sets relating to negotiating positions, future procurements or pending or reasonably anticipated legal or administrative proceedings; or</p> <p>4. that is subject to privacy laws, student records laws or subject to copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret protection, or to a confidentiality agreement, attorney/client privilege or that are otherwise protected by law or contract; or</p> <p>5. that includes or constitutes proprietary applications, computer code, software, operating systems or similar materials; or</p> <p>6. that includes or constitutes employment records, internal employee-related directories or lists, facilities data, information technology, or internal service-desk data of the City; or</p> <p>7. which, if disclosed by the City, might in the City’s discretion, raise privacy, confidentiality or security concerns or jeopardize or have the potential to jeopardize public health, safety or welfare.</p> <p>G. “Open Data Review Board” refers to a board established by the City Manager to develop, under the direction of the City Manager, rules and standards for implementation of an Open Data policy.</p> <p>H. “Open Data” shall mean all Data or Data Sets that the City makes accessible to the public pursuant to this Ordinance.</p> <p>2.126.030 –Data Accessibility</p> <p>A. For the purpose of identifying which Data or Data Sets shall be made accessible as Open Data, the City shall consider whether the information in the Data or Data Set:</p> <p>1. improves public knowledge of the operations of the City or furthers the goals of the City; or</p> <p>2. increases City accountability, efficiency, responsiveness or delivery of services; or</p> <p>3. makes available data frequently requested by the public or City departments; or</p> <p>4. adds to the public knowledge about Cambridge.</p> <p>B.

An Open Data Review Board will be established by the City Manager within one hundred and twenty (120) days from the Effective Date of this Chapter, to recommend to the City Manager rules and standards for implementation of an Open Data policy, including a means by which to determine the Data or Data Sets that are appropriate for public accessibility and a timeline for policy implementation.
