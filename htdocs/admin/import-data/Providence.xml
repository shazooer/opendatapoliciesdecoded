 <p>WHEREAS, uncomplicated and timely access to public records, and a means of recourse regarding those records, is the people’s ultimate defense from government corruption; and
 <p>WHEREAS, in the spirit of the sentiment “Sunshine is the best disinfectant,” as stated by United States Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, the City of Providence must make public records and processes transparent and open to public scrutiny in order to expose any government misconduct; and

 <p>WHEREAS, the City of Providence posts public meetings and provides public records by request, in accordance with Rhode Island General Laws, Ã‚ § 42-46-8(a), the Open Meetings Act, and Ã‚ § 38-2-8(b), the Access to Public Records Act;
