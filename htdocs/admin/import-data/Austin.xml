<p>SUBJECT: City of Austin Open Government Directive</p> <p>The City of Austin is fully committed to transparency, efficiency, collaboration, and an Open Government. As such, the City Manager and staff are developing new and innovative strategies to engage our city's talented high-tech community and to make our internal processes more effective.</p> <p>Per Council Resolution No. 20111208-074, Council directed that the City Manager develop an Open Government Framework to address the following:</p> <p>1.  Open Data</p> <p>2.  Open Source Platforms</p> <p>3.  Mobile applications</p> <p>4.  Social media.</p> <p>Under the City Manager's leadership, staff has diligently worked to execute those directives making significant progress including the publication of the award-winning City of Austin's Data Portal which includes over 60 datasets, 11 charts, and 18 interactive maps.</p> <p>This memo serves to take yet another step toward our goals for Open Government in releasing the City of Austin Open Government Directive. This Directive outlines specific steps for City Departments to achieve the goal of creating a more open government, increasing public trust, and establishing a system of public participation, collaboration, and accountability.</p> <p>I will provide further updates on staff's progress on the Open Government initiative during the August 28, 2013 Audit and Finance Committee meeting.</p> <p>Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p> <p>City of Austin Open Government Directive</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>With the development of new technologies and an increasingly connected and engaged population, a growing expectation has been placed on the City of Austin government leaders to adopt open government practices that will promote transparency, citizen participation, and collaboration. In order to change how government works, provide more effective government services, and establish a more robust democracy, the City of Austin adopts the following open government principles:</p> <p>·         The City of Austin is committed to transparency. The City of Austin should adopt policies, practices, and procedures that allow citizens to have access to understandable, accurate, reusable, and auditable data and information about government operations and decision-making (with updates available as they are made, whenever possible). City departments should use new technologies to put information about their operations and decisions online. Departments should also seek public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public. The City should operate under a presumption of openness and accessibility, while also maintaining privacy, confidentiality, security and compliance with all relevant laws. These policies, practices, and procedures will increase accountability, promote informed public participation, and create economic development opportunities.</p> <p>·         The City of Austin is committed to meaningful public participation. The City of Austin believes members of the public have a valuable role in governing their communities and should have opportunities to take part in government decision-making. The City of Austin supports establishing guidelines and practices that will enable the public to contribute opinions and ideas regarding political, economic, management, and other decisions using a variety of methods, as conveniently as possible for citizens. These guidelines and practices will create more informed and effective policies and enhance and expand opportunities for the public to participate throughout decision-making processes.</p> <p>·         The City of Austin is committed to collaborating with the public and across government. The City of Austin should create opportunities to work jointly with individuals as well as public, non­profit, academic, and private sector groups to address the needs of the community. The City should also enhance and expand its cooperation among City departments and other governmental agencies in order to more effectively fulfill the City's obligations to citizens. Furthermore, citizens are encouraged to contribute their time and knowledge. The City will take steps to provide efficient and effective methods of participating and collaborating, and the City commits to incorporating citizen feedback into decision-making processes.</p> <p>·         The City of Austin is committed to sharing best practices and software and other resources with other government entities.</p> <p>The City of Austin acknowledges that, in the face of budget decreases, government entities at every level must cut costs and find efficiencies. An enormous cost-saving opportunity exists in the City's information technology resource acquisition practices. The City of Austin supports collaborating with other government entities to share technology resources, lessons learned, and best practices; reform procurement practices, policies, and procedures; and learn to function not only as a provider of services but as a source for other government entities, the public, and other organizations to add value to the City's services.</p> <p>·         Open Government Directive: These commitments require that the City create a legal framework that will institutionalize the principles of transparency, participation, and collaboration into the culture and work of The City of Austin government. Therefore, the City Manager shall establish within [90 days] an Open Government Directive to guide the implementation of open government.</p> <p>The City of Austin is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in government. City officials will work together and with the public to ensure open and effective government as well as public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, collaboration, and accountability.</p> <p>This memorandum requires The City of Austin departments and agencies to take the following steps to achieve the goal of creating a more open government:</p> <p>1.

The City has established processes to revise its Open Government Plan to reflect changing public needs and new technologies.</p> <p>c. Open Government Operating Board: Within [45] days, the City Manager shall establish an</p> <p>operating board that focuses on transparency, accountability, public participation, and</p> <p>collaboration within the City of Austin government. This group, with senior level representation from program and management offices throughout the City of Austin, will serve several critical functions, including:</p> <p>i.          Transparency Forum: The operating board will provide a forum to share best practices on innovative ideas to promote transparency, including system and process solutions for information collection, aggregation, validation, and dissemination. In particular, the board will govern the City of Austin open data initiative and direct Department participation.</p> <p>ii.        Participation and Collaboration Forum: The working group will provide a forum to share best practices on innovative ideas to promote participation and collaboration, including how to experiment with new technologies, take advantage of the expertise and insight of people both inside and outside the City of Austin government, and form high impact collaborations with researchers, the private sector, and the public.</p> <p>iii.                  	Public Input Forum: The working group will provide a forum for developing</p> <p>resolutions to issues described through the public feedback mechanisms of the Open Government Web page.</p> <p>d. Incentives: Within 90 days, the Chief Financial Officer will issue, through separate guidance or as part of any planned comprehensive management guidance (such as the Open Government Operating Board), a framework for how the City of Austin can use challenges, prizes, and other incentive-backed strategies to find innovative or cost-effective solutions to improving open government.</p> <p>3. Utilize Accessible and Emerging Technology/Tools</p> <p>Departments, in coordination with the City of Austin Communication Technology Management department and Purchasing Office, should seek opportunities to utilize new and emerging technologies, whenever possible, to make software solutions available to as many users as possible. Utilizing Open Source software/platforms, web (browser based) applications for mobile devices and Agile project methodologies, offers departments great potential to deliver quality software applications that are accessible, scalable, flexible, shareable/reusable and reflect common tools and practices used to innovate in private industry.</p> <p>a.     Open Source Software/Platforms (OSS): The Open Government Plan will include formal plans to utilize Open Source software/platforms when applicable. OSS solutions should be included for consideration in any software procurement or development strategy. Utilizing OSS opens opportunities for community participation, application sharing across agencies/governments and potential cost savings/ROI.</p> <p>b.     Mobile Application Development: To keep pace with the growing amount of internet users utilizing mobile devices (phone, tablets, etc.), Departments should seek to provide platform independent software applications when applicable and fit within the City of Austin's overall mobile strategy.</p> <p></p> <p>c. 	Agile Project Management: In an effort to keep pace with the fast moving world of technology and to more readily respond to changing requirements, the City of Austin should utilize Agile Project Management methodologies whenever possible. These methodologies allow the flexibility for software development projects to adjust to customer requirements</p> <p>d. 	Procurement: Within [90] days the Purchasing Officer will include in standard Request for Proposal (RFP) documentation, language requiring the examination of at least one Open Source solution for all software application purchases. In addition, language related to software vendors being able to provide mobile ready versions of their products, will be required to meet the City of Austin's mobile application strategy.</p> <p>4. Create an Enabling Policy Framework for Open Government</p> <p>Emerging technologies open new forms of communication between government and the public. Achieving a more open government will require the various professional disciplines within the government (such as policy, legal, procurement, finance, and technology operations) to work together to define and develop open government solutions. Policies should be regularly reviewed and revised to realize the potential of technology for open government.</p> <p>a.   	Identification of Barriers, Guidance, and Revisions: Within 120 days, the City Attorney, in consultation with the City's Chief Information Officer, will review existing The City of Austin policies to identify impediments to open government and to the use of new technologies and, where necessary, issue clarifying guidance and/or propose revisions to such policies, to promote greater openness in government.</p> <p>b.   	Publication of Guidance and Proposed Policy Changes: Any clarifying guidance and/or proposed policies related to this Open Government Directive will be available through the City's Open Government Web page.</p> <p></p> <p>Notes:</p> <p>[1]    The timely and consistent publication of government information is of critical importance to the use of that information. Adherence to a publication schedule is critical to the success of this open government mandate. It is not enough to simply publish information without managing that information. Therefore, it is important that the mayor or another executive leader or leaders to review the resources necessary to manage the on-going publication effort, but the directive should not eliminate the schedule as part of a publication plan.</p> <p>[2]    Paragraph c is intended to embody the underlying intent of Freedom of Information/Open Records laws in that information held and maintained by the government is public information. As such, the default setting must be to release information and publication should only be withheld if a valid privacy, security, or privilege exists. A valid privacy, security, or privilege concerns include, but are not limited to, personal identifying information, critical infrastructure information, information related to an on­going criminal investigation, or any publication that may breach an individual or groups legal rights. If the local government chooses to withhold information from publication that government entity should provide the public with a reasonably detailed explanation for withholding the information. Such explanation should be created to foster trust and instill transparency in the publication process. Furthermore, in order to provide consistent application the City's council should provide detailed guidelines regarding the limited publication exemptions.</p> <p>[3]    One of the greatest strains on government resources is compliance with open records requests. As such, local governments should use the open government directive as an opportunity to preemptively publish government information before an open records request is received. Furthermore, the local government should publish information if such information is frequently requested or if the information is a data set.</p> <p>[4]    Paragraph d is intended to result in the maximum use of government information. Governments must publish information that is machine-readable as well as human-readable. Although maximum openness is achieved through publication in open formats, City's should take steps to publish what information they have in whatever format they have and then take steps to convert that information into open formats.</p> <p>[5]  Government information includes data sets collected and maintained by the local government. Dissemination of these data sets is as important as all other forms of publication. Therefore, local government should actively release this data to the public for use and re-use. It is again critical that data be released in an open format that is machine readable and accessible.</p> <p>[6]  Unlike US Federal Government information, state and local government information is not in the public domain as a matter of law unless the state or local law dictates otherwise. Some local governments can and do exercise copy, trade, and intellectual property rights over government information. This practice significantly impacts the use of government information by the public and hinders open government efforts. Local governments should, therefore, release all government information free of any such right and should not exercise these rights after release. However, the City may reserve the right to enforce reasonable privacy, security, and privilege rights on government information. Finally, if license or restrictions are asserted then the license and restriction should be minimally restrictive so that they do not significantly impugn the use and derivative use of the information</p> <p>Sources:</p> <p>Open Data Handbook (http://opendatahandbook.org/en/)</p> <p>Open Government Initiative (http://opengovernmentinitiative.org/)</p> <p></p>
